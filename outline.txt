This file contains the outline for the bowling scorer project. This project contains a program called
CMBowling_Scorer which takes input from the user(s) playing a single game of bowling. The program
is designed to work similarly to a score guide you may find on a tv screen at a bowling alley. 

Typically a bowling alley has some sort of controller with a keypad for entering in user data
which will then display on the screen. Unlike a bowling alley scorer, the user must enter 
the results from each bowl (for obvious reasons).

Outline:

[1] Capturing player names

Capture user each players name and store this information in a vector titled names.
The code block for capturing the names of players should also compute the number of 
players based off the number of entries that do not equal "done". The user will enter
"done" when they have finished entering in player names.

Items needed:
	1. While loop for capturing player names
	2. Vector for storing player names

[2] Capturing each bowling scores

Capture the number of pins knocked over after each bowl for each of the players.
This can be done one player at a time, but to remain as similar to a traditional 
bowling scorer as possible, this should be done by looping through each player and
capturing the number of pins knocked over for two bowls then looping to the next player.

*Note: This section should allow for a third bowl on frame 10 to be possible for the 
program to work correctly

Items needed:
	1. For loop which loops through the vector of names
	2. Nested for loop which loops through the number of bowls for each player (2 at a time)
	3. Array for storing the number of pins knocked over for each player. (2D array?)
